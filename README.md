# Mastermind
A command-line Ruby implementation of the code-breaking game Mastermind.

## Description

This is my solution to Odin's [Mastermind project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind).

The player can choose to play as either the creator or breaker of a secret code of 4 colors, choosing from 6 different
colors. Feedback is provided after each guess, and the code must be broken within 12 turns. The game is played against
the computer.
